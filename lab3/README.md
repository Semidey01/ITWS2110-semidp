# Weather & Location Dashboard

## Project Description:

A dynamic web application that displays real-time weather information and country data for Troy, NY, with support for geolocation-based weather updates. This lab demonstrates the integration of multiple REST APIs using AJAX techniques to create an interactive, data-driven web experience. The application uses asynchronous JavaScript to fetch and display data without requiring page refreshes.

## APIs Used:

### OpenWeatherMap API

**Endpoint**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`

**Purpose**: Provides current weather data for specified locations

**Information Retrieved**:
- Current temperature (¬∞F)
- "Feels like" temperature
- Weather description (e.g., "clear sky", "light rain")
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed (mph)
- Atmospheric pressure (hPa)
- Location name and country code

**Usage**: 
- Default location: Troy, NY, US
- Supports both city name queries and coordinate-based queries (for geolocation feature)
- Temperature units set to imperial (Fahrenheit)

### REST Countries API

**Endpoint**: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/us`

**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive country information

**Information Retrieved**:
- Country name (common and official)
- Population
- Capital city
- Region and subregion
- Languages spoken
- Currency name and symbol
- Country flag (PNG format)
- Country codes (cca2, cca3)

**Usage**: 
- Displays information about the United States (default for Troy, NY)
- Updates dynamically when using geolocation to show the country of the detected location

## Temperature Color Feature:

The application includes a visual temperature indicator that changes the color of the temperature display based on the current temperature reading. This provides an intuitive understanding of the weather conditions.

### Temperature Color Scale:

- **0-20¬∞F**: Bright blue (#4dabf5) - Freezing
- **21-40¬∞F**: Light blue (#74c0fc) - Cold
- **41-60¬∞F**: Very light blue (#a5d8ff) - Cool
- **61-70¬∞F**: Light green (#b2f2bb) - Mild
- **71-80¬∞F**: Peach (#ffd8a8) - Warm
- **81-90¬∞F**: Orange (#ffa94d) - Hot
- **91+¬∞F**: Red (#ff6b6b) - Very Hot

The color updates automatically whenever the temperature data is refreshed.

## Geolocation Feature:

The application includes a bonus geolocation feature that allows users to:
- Request weather data for their current location
- Automatically update country information based on detected location
- Receive clear feedback about the location detection process

**How it works**:
1. Click the "üåç Get Weather for My Location" button
2. Grant location permission when prompted by your browser
3. The app retrieves your coordinates and fetches weather data
4. Both weather and country information update to reflect your location

## File Structure:

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ajax-api.js        # JavaScript for API calls and functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css          # Styling and responsive design
```

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Async/await for API calls, DOM manipulation
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: Implemented using the Fetch API to make asynchronous HTTP requests to external APIs without page reloads
- **Fetch API**: Modern AJAX technique for making HTTP requests to OpenWeatherMap and REST Countries APIs
- **Geolocation API**: Browser-based location detection

## Error Handling:

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Failed API requests
- Network connectivity issues
- Geolocation permission denials
- Invalid location data
- API response errors

Error messages are displayed clearly to the user with specific information about what went wrong.
